# Smart-Dustbin
In order to Make things contactless and also to avoid 
Infection in this pandemic, we can design a simple project
Using Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor, Battery. 
After uploading the code to Arduino Uno, the Ultrasonic sensor
Detects the motion in front of dustbin and found any the lid opens
with the help of Servo Motor.
